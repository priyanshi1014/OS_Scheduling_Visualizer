# Operating System Scheduling Algorithms

This project is a **visual representation** of various CPU scheduling algorithms using **HTML and CSS**. It is designed to help users understand the basic working and differences between popular scheduling techniques in Operating Systems.

## 🔍 Project Overview

Operating System Scheduling is crucial for process management. This project visually demonstrates how different scheduling algorithms work, such as:

- **First-Come, First-Served (FCFS)**
- **Shortest Job First (SJF)**
- **Round Robin (RR)**
- **Priority Scheduling**

This web-based simulation is purely front-end (HTML + CSS) and aims to provide a simple, intuitive, and educational experience.

## 💻 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: For structure and content
- **CSS3**: For layout and styling
## 🧠 Features

- 📊 Easy-to-understand layout of Gantt charts or process flows
- 🎨 Responsive and visually clear interface
- 📚 Great for academic demonstrations or learning OS scheduling

## 🚀 Getting Started

To run the project:

1. Download or clone this repository.
2. Open `final.html` or any specific algorithm file in your web browser.
3. Explore how each algorithm schedules the processes visually.

## 📌 Use Cases

- OS course projects
- Demonstration in classrooms
- Self-learning tool
